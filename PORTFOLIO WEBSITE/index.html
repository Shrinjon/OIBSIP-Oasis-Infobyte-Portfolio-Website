       <h1>Hi, It's <span>Shrinjon</span></h1>
       <h3>I'm a <span>Frontend Developer</span></h3>
       <p>I’m a front-end developer with over 5 years of experience in building responsive and user-friendly web applications. 
        I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I have experience with frameworks like React and Vue.js. 
        I’ve worked on projects for various industries, including e-commerce and education, where I focused on improving user experience and optimizing performance.
        I’m always exploring new technologies to stay updated in this fast-evolving field. Outside of coding, I enjoy photography and hiking, which often inspire my creative process.</p>

            <h4>Mobile App Development</h4>
            <p>Mobile app development is the process of creating software for mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, and digital assistants. 
              It involves a number of steps, including: 
              Planning: Establishing the app's requirements, such as its features, target audience, and problems it will solve 
              Design: Creating the app's user interface and user experience (UI/UX) 
              Coding: Writing the app using programming languages like Java, Swift, C#, and HTML5 
              Testing: Ensuring the app works as intended 
              Deployment: Releasing the app to the public 
              Mobile apps can be preinstalled on a device, downloaded from an app store, or accessed through a web browser. 
              The most common platforms for mobile apps are Android and iOS, but some developers create native apps for each platform separately. 
              Others use a hybrid approach, creating a single codebase that works on multiple platforms. </p>

            <h4>Frontend Development</h4>
            <p>Front-end developers use programming languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the following: 
              User interface (UI): The graphical user interface that users interact with, such as buttons, text boxes, and graphics 
              Interactive features: Features that make the website responsive and engaging 
              Accessibility: Features that make the website usable by people with disabilities 
              Front-end developers also need to ensure that websites work consistently across different browsers and platforms. They may use browser developer tools to debug issues and conduct testing. 
              Front-end development connects to back-end development, which deals with the website's server, users' data, and information. Back-end developers use programming languages like Java, Ruby, and Python. 
              Some soft skills that can be helpful for front-end developers include: Creativity, Problem-solving skills, Written and verbal communication skills, and Teamwork.  </p>

            <h4>Backend Development</h4>
            <p>Back-end development is the process of building the server-side components of a website or mobile app, which is responsible for the functionality and performance of the application. Back-end developers work on the parts of a website or app that are not visible to the user, such as the databases, servers, and application logic. 
              Back-end development involves: 
              Writing code
              Back-end developers use code to manage data storage, server logic, and the application's architecture. 
              Working with databases
              Back-end developers use code to help browsers communicate with databases, store, understand, and delete data. 
              Collaborating with other teams
              Back-end developers work with front-end developers, product managers, and others to build the structure of a website or app. 
              Using a variety of tools and frameworks
              Back-end developers use a variety of tools and frameworks, including programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby, and Node.js, as well as libraries and APIs. 
              Back-end development is important because it ensures that websites and apps perform well, handle large numbers of user requests, and are secure.  </p>
